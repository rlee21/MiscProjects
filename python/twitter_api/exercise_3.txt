# Describe likely joins for tables
* DR inner join to LOCATION where dr.primary_location_id = location.id because every doctor should have a primary location
* DR left outer join to REVIEW where dr.id = review.dr_id because not every doctor will have a review and so you want to avoid mistakenly filtering doctor records by using an inner join
* DR left outer join to VIDEO where dr.id = video.dr_id because not every doctor has a video and so you want to avoid mistakenly filtering doctor records by using an inner join
* DR inner join to CONSULT_REQUESTS where dr.id = consult_requests.dr_id because every consultation request should have a corresponding doctor
* LOCATION inner join to LOCATION_BUNDLE where location.location_bundle_id = location_bundle.id because every location should have a corresponding location bundle
* LOCATION inner join to USER where location.id = user.location_id because every user should have a location
* REVIEW inner join to USER where review.user_id = user.id because every review should have a user that generated the review
* CONSULT_REQUESTS inner join to USER where consult_requests.user_id = user.id
* VIDEO left outer join to VIDEO_COMMENTS where video.id = video_comments.video_id because not every video will have comments and so you want to avoid mistakenly filtering video records by using an inner join 
* VIDEO_COMMENTS inner join to USER where video_comments.user_id = user.id because every video comment should have a user that posted the comment


# Insightful dimensions and measures for the business
* Dimensions
    - doctor attributes like Primary specialty, Address, City, State, Zip, Location Bundle Name

    - user
    - review star rating
    - Date
* Measures
    - number of doctors
    - number of users
    - number of reviews
    - number of videos
